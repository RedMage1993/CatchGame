CatchGame (This project is now complete.)

<hr>

Following along a Unity tutorial at unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/2d-catch-game-pt-1

Some things that I do, especially in the Scripts folder, may differ from the tutorial due to deprecated methods used in the live sessions. Comments left wherever such a change occurs, either because of deprecation or because of a method I feel is more efficient.
